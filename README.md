## Project Summary

### genyus Roundtable

An online peer-led focus group for unrivalled research â€” genyus Roundtable is an opportunity for people with shared commonalities to connect and discuss research which directly involves their broader peer groups. These bespoke focus groups can discuss questions which are co-designed by (but not guided by) reputable research groups, to enhance the lived experience of the focus group and their peers. The Roundtable is hosted by a Peer with Lived Expertise.
Peer Groups (people with shared commonalities) benefit from participating by building confidence and interpersonal connections plus enhancing self-advocacy skills, while Research and Health Organisations who are looking to better support their constituents also benefit from the process of conducting a Roundtable by collecting non-biased research.

The project solution will encompass all current processes involved in the genyus Roundtable:
- Creation of a branded landing page for each focus group, in partnership with Research and Health Organisation Partners;
- The branded landing page will feature: information on the focus group, dates and times for each Roundtable, the ability for participants to self-allocate into a Roundtable or email support with a request to add additional Roundtables;
- The ability for genyus admin to approve or decline participants who register for a Roundtable;
- Sending confirmation emails to participants approved for a session time with a calendar event invite and video conference link;
- Sending gratitude emails to participants who have participated in a Roundtable, as well as Certificate of attendance and payment; and 
- Creation of a Research and Health Organisation Partners landing page that will display Roundtable video recordings, as well as other documents.
