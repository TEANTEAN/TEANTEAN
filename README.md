## Project Summary

### Genyus Roundtable

An online peer-led focus group for unrivalled research â€” genyus Roundtable is an opportunity for people with shared commonalities to connect and discuss research which directly involves their broader peer groups. These bespoke focus groups can discuss questions which are co-designed by (but not guided by) reputable research groups, to enhance the lived experience of the focus group and their peers. The Roundtable is hosted by a Peer with Lived Expertise.

Peer Groups (people with shared commonalities) benefit from participating by building confidence and interpersonal connections plus enhancing self-advocacy skills, while Research and Health Organisations who are looking to better support their constituents also benefit from the process of conducting a Roundtable by collecting non-biased research.
